// Interactive lesson mode — turning a lesson document into an ordered walkthrough
// a learner steps through one screen at a time, typing an answer to each question.
//
// This is a *derived* view of the existing document, not a new document shape:
// nothing is added to `doc` when a lesson is authored, so every lesson ever
// published — including ones made before this feature existed, and ones written
// by the MCP server — is playable. A lesson with no questions is still playable;
// it simply has no answer fields.
//
// The walkthrough is built once per lesson and consists of two kinds of step:
//
//   content  — a section's non-question blocks (text, images, spelling words),
//              shown together as that section's material.
//   question — a single question block, with a text field for the learner's
//              answer. Questions come in document order within their section,
//              after that section's content.
//
// A section with no content blocks contributes no content step (an all-questions
// section goes straight to its first question), and a section with nothing in it
// at all contributes nothing. Question numbering restarts per section, matching
// the editor's `Q7`-style numbering.
//
// The learner's typed answers are stored privately in their account (see
// lessonResponses.js and the Worker's /lessons/:id/responses). The limits below
// are shared with the Worker so the browser and server agree on what a valid
// submission is.

import { vaktText } from "./vakt.js";

// Block types that make up a section's material, in the order the document has
// them. Everything that isn't a question block and isn't unknown to us.
//
// VAKT activities are in here rather than being steps of their own: a regulation
// break is something whoever is running the lesson does with the speller, not
// something the speller answers, so it belongs with the section's material and
// must not be counted by the progress bar.
