// Shared definitions for the VAKT block — a regulation activity, not a question.
//
// VAKT (visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, tactile) activities are the movement and
// sensory breaks a lesson is punctuated with: "VAKT: Bob likes to do jumping
// jacks. Let's do 3 of those." They are addressed to whoever is running the
// lesson, they are never answered, and they are never scored — which is why they
// are their own block type rather than a seventh question type. Questions carry
// answers, print in the footer legend, and are counted by interactive mode's
// progress; a VAKT activity does none of those things.
//
// Imported by the editor (SectionCard / ContentBlock), the read-only viewer, the
// exporters and the importers, so the colour, the label and the block shape stay
// in sync everywhere.
//
// A VAKT block carries three things:
//   text   the activity itself, in the author's words, without the "VAKT:" label
//          (the label is added by whatever renders the block — see VAKT_LABEL).
//   links  optional outward links: a video to play, a printable, a song. Held as
//          { id, label, url } rows so each has a stable React/collab key.
//   image  an optional picture, referenced by content hash exactly as an image
//          block's is, so it resolves, uploads and exports through the same path.

import { isSafeLink } from "./richText.js";

// The accent colour: a bright, unambiguous red — the one colour the question
// types and the teal spelling block deliberately leave free, so a regulation
// break is the thing that jumps off a page of colour-coded prompts. Red at hue 0
// rather than anything warmer: an orange or an amber would collide with the
// `multiple` question type, which is what pushed that type off burnt orange in
// the first place (see questions.js).

// keeps one authored string from ever carrying two prefixes, and lets the label
// be translated on screen while the export keeps its canonical form.
