// Interactive mode — working through a published lesson one step at a time
// instead of reading it as a page.
//
// A section's material pops up as its own step, then that section's questions
// pop up one at a time, each with a text field. The walkthrough is derived from
// the lesson document by buildInteractiveSteps — nothing is stored in a lesson to
// make it playable, so every lesson ever published works here, including ones
// written before this existed and ones with no questions at all.
//
// It takes over the whole viewport. A lesson step is one thing to read or one
// question to answer, and a dialog floating over the page you just left keeps
// that page in the corner of the eye competing for attention.
//
// The blocks are re-rendered here rather than reusing LessonView. LessonView
// follows the theme too, but it keeps the export's document proportions — page
// text sizes, the export's section rules — which is right for reading a lesson
// as a page and wrong for a full-screen surface you read and answer on one step
// at a time. So this file draws text, images and spelling words itself, at its
// own scale, from the same block shapes; only the *presentation* differs, never
// the content.
//
// What the learner types is theirs. The finished run-through is sent once, at
// the end, to their own account (see core/lessonResponses.js and the privacy
// note in the Worker's routes/lessonResponses.js). The lesson's author never
// sees it.
//
// Until then it is also written to this browser as they type (see
// core/browser/interactiveProgress.js), so a lesson closed half-way reopens
// where it was left, answers and all. That local copy never leaves the device
// and is dropped as soon as the run-through it belongs to is finished and filed.
//
// A question block carries the author's own answer, and the eye button in the
// top bar reveals it — for whoever is running the lesson at the front of a room,
// who otherwise has to keep the lesson open in a second window to see what they
// are walking a class towards. It starts off every time interactive mode opens,
// so a learner's own run-through never begins with the answers on screen.
//
// One thing this deliberately does NOT do: mark answers. Revealing the author's
// answer is a presenter putting it on screen deliberately; it is never compared
// against what the learner typed and no verdict is ever drawn. Spelling lessons
// are about the learner producing the response, and a right/wrong verdict from a
// string comparison would be both wrong a lot of the time and the wrong shape of
// feedback.
//
// Speech is optional and off until asked for; see lib/useSpeech.js.
