| `add_image`             | Download a searched image and insert it as an image block in a lesson.                          |

Plus five more on the stdio transport, for joining a lesson the user is editing live:
`join_collab_session`, `read_collab_doc`, `edit_collab_doc`, `send_collab_chat` and
`leave_collab_session`. See [Live sessions](/mcp-server/live-sessions).

## Every edit is a version

A lesson is a [real git repository](/monorepo/version-history), and the web editor
commits as you type. The MCP server does the same: `create_lesson`, `update_lesson`,
`patch_lesson` and `add_image` each save the document **and** commit it, so an
assistant's work turns up in the lesson's **History** tab beside your own — one entry
per tool call, with the diff, and revertable from there if you don't like it.

Every write returns a `history` object saying what was recorded:

```json
{ "recorded": true, "commit": "8f1c…", "summary": "Edit 1 text block" }
```

Some things worth knowing:

- **The commit says an assistant made it.** The hub attributes writes to the account
  whose token the server is using — yours — so a commit that said nothing more would
  put your name against changes you didn't write. The message carries a line naming the
  connecting client (`Made by an AI assistant via Claude Desktop`), the same provenance
  a proposal's body gets.
- **A lesson whose document had run ahead of its history catches up first**, in a commit
  of its own labelled as such. That happens to a lesson last saved when a history push
  failed, and to every lesson edited over MCP before this existed: the row holds content
  no commit accounts for. Committing it separately keeps it out of the assistant's diff
  rather than attributing it there. A lesson with no history at all gets one started the
  same way, from its previous content.
- **A failed commit never fails the write.** The document and the repository are two
  stores, and the document is saved first. If the history push is refused — most often
  because you saved the lesson from the editor in between, which the
  [compare-and-swap](/monorepo/version-history) is there to catch — the edit still
  stands, and `history.recorded` comes back `false` with the reason, for the assistant
  to pass on.
- **Nothing is committed when nothing changed.** An edit that leaves the stored content
  identical records no version, rather than an empty one.
- **The assistant can name the version.** `patch_lesson` and `update_lesson` take a
  `summary`, which becomes the version's title instead of the mechanical description of
  what changed. See [Building a lesson in passes](#building-a-lesson-in-passes).

## Decisions that are the user's

Three things this server does are the user's call rather than the assistant's: **deleting a
lesson**, which cannot be undone; **publishing one**, which puts it in front of strangers
under their name; and **overriding the authoring standard** with `skipValidation`, which is
meant for a user who deliberately wants what the standard forbids.

All three were governed only by prose in the tool descriptions — "ask the user first" —
which is advice the model may or may not follow, and which neither the server nor the user
can check after the fact. On a client that supports **elicitation**, the server now asks
them directly, mid-tool-call, and their answer decides it:

- **`delete_lesson`** names the lesson and says what goes with it, and points at
  unpublishing as the reversible alternative. Say no and nothing is deleted.
- **Publishing** — `set_lesson_published(true)`, or `published: true` on `create_lesson`,
  `update_lesson` or `patch_lesson`. See below.
- **`skipValidation`** lists the defects that would be waived before waiving them. See
  [Lesson validation](/mcp-server/lesson-validation#skipvalidation).

### Publishing

Publishing is asked about only **on the way out**, and only when public is a change:
unpublishing is never confirmed (it only ever makes a lesson less visible), and neither is
`published: true` on a lesson that is already public.

A refusal never costs the work. On the editing tools `published` rides along with a content
change, so the content is written either way and only the visibility is held back; on
`create_lesson` the lesson is created as a private draft rather than not at all. The result
carries a `note` saying so, because the assistant asked for something it didn't get and
would otherwise assume the field was ignored:

```json
{
  "id": "…",
  "note": "The content changes were saved, but the user was asked about publishing and said no, so the lesson is still a PRIVATE DRAFT. …"
}
```

This is the same principle as the [image picker](./interactive-views.md): where a choice is
genuinely the user's, an assistant that makes it takes it away from them.

A refusal is not an error. `delete_lesson` returns a normal result saying the user declined
and telling the assistant not to ask again unprompted; a refused `skipValidation` fails the
write, because a write that was never permitted didn't happen.

**On a client that can't ask, both tools behave exactly as they did before** — elicitation
is optional in the MCP spec and most clients don't implement it, so failing closed would
make `delete_lesson` unusable for most people. Both tool descriptions say so, and tell the
assistant to ask in the conversation regardless.

## Proposing changes instead of making them

An assistant can change a lesson two ways, and which one it should use is a question
about **who decides**, not about the size of the edit.

`patch_lesson` writes straight to the lesson. It's right for a correction the user has
asked for outright — a typo, a wrong answer — where a review step is only friction.

**`fork_lesson` + `propose_changes`** leaves the lesson untouched and puts the changes in
its [Proposals](/web-app/pull-requests) tab instead, where a person reads the diff and
merges or declines it:

```text
fork_lesson({ lessonId })          -> a private draft fork you own
patch_lesson({ id: fork.id, … })   -> edit THE FORK
propose_changes({ forkLessonId })  -> a proposal, with a URL to review it
```

That's the only available route for a lesson somebody else wrote — nobody can save over
another person's lesson — and it's the better route whenever the user wants to look over
the assistant's work before it goes live. `propose_changes` returns the proposal's `url`;
the assistant is expected to hand that over and stop, rather than report the change as
done.

Some mechanics worth knowing:

- **A fork is a real clone.** It carries the original's git history, so the reviewer's
  merge is a true three-way merge against the commit the two diverged from, block by
  block. A lesson with no stored history can still be forked, but the fork shares no
  ancestor with it, so the whole document reads as the change. `fork_lesson` says which
  happened.
- **A proposal carries the fork's history**, which is the commits the edits to it made
  (see above) against the commit the fork and the lesson last shared. So the reviewer
  reads the change as a sequence, not as one lump, and `changes` in the result is stated
  against the lesson rather than against whatever the last edit happened to do.
- **Proposing after the fork stopped moving is refused.** There is nothing to add to a
  proposal that already holds exactly these changes, and bumping its revision would send
  the reviewer back to a diff that hasn't changed.
- **Proposing again updates the proposal already open** from that fork, rather than
  stacking a second one beside it — same request, same discussion, new contents, with
  the version number recorded. That's what you want after the human asks for a change;
  the `title` and `body` passed are then ignored, since the ones already there are what
  they have been reading. `updated` in the result says which happened. (At most 5 open
  against one lesson, and at most 20 updates to one proposal.)
- **Images aren't copied.** Blocks reference them by content hash and the bytes are
  already stored, so forking is cheap.
- **Forks are private drafts** and count against the draft cap, so `delete_lesson` the
  fork once its proposal has been resolved.
- **Merging is never the assistant's.** It is the reviewer's decision, taken in the web
  app or by clicking Merge in `review_proposal`'s view — see
  [Deciding a proposal in the conversation](#deciding-a-proposal-in-the-conversation).
  There is no path by which the assistant settles one itself; `list_lesson_proposals` is
  how it finds out what the reviewer decided.

Because the assistant acts as the account it's signed in with, a proposal against your
_own_ lesson is opened by _you_ — so its body carries a note saying an assistant wrote
it, and the notification you get reads "Changes are waiting for your review".

## Reading a proposal

`list_lesson_proposals` gives titles and status and nothing about the contents.
**`review_proposal`** is what reads one: the block-by-block diff, a tally of it, and
whether it would merge cleanly.

```text
review_proposal({ lessonId })            -> the newest open proposal's diff
review_proposal({ lessonId, pullId })    -> a particular one
```

It writes nothing at all — no merge, no commit, no status change — and works on every
client, text or rendered.

Two things about what it computes are worth stating, because getting either wrong
misleads a reviewer rather than failing:

- **The diff is measured from the merge base**, the commit the proposal and the lesson
  last shared — that is what the proposal is _asking for_. Measured against the lesson's
  current tip instead, every change the lesson's own author made since the fork left
  would appear in it, reversed, as though the proposer wanted them undone.
- **Conflicts are judged against the lesson's saved document**, not against the doc at
  its stored git tip. Those can differ (an edit whose history push failed), and this is
  the tool where the difference is felt: `merge_proposal` merges the saved document, so
  judging conflicts against the tip could offer a live Merge button on a proposal that
  then refuses.

`conflicts` names the blocks both sides have rewritten. Those are the ones a merge cannot
decide on its own, and they're why `mergeable` in the result can be false while the diff
reads perfectly well.

## Deciding a proposal in the conversation

Reading a proposal is the assistant's job. Deciding one is the reviewer's, and it used to
mean leaving the conversation: `propose_changes` hands over a URL, and finding out what
happened meant asking or polling.

On a client that renders [interactive views](./interactive-views.md), `review_proposal`'s
diff arrives with **Merge** and **Decline** on it, and the same human decision is taken in
place. Nothing about who decides has changed — only where they can click.

That is enforced rather than asked for. `merge_proposal` and `decline_proposal` are
declared `visibility: ["app"]`: a host that reads that keeps them out of the model's
tool list entirely, so the only thing that can call them is a button on the card. For a
host that ignores it, both tools check for themselves whether a view was ever drawn —
where none was, nobody pressed anything, and the call is refused with a pointer to the
proposal's `url`. Their descriptions say the same in plain words, since a model that can
see them is exactly the case the metadata failed to cover.

**The assistant is told to stop when the diff is showing**, the same way it is for the
[image picker](#letting-the-user-pick-the-picture) and for the same reason: the result
leads with an instruction to end the turn — don't merge it, don't decline it, and don't
send them to the web app for something the buttons already do — with the payload behind
it. On a text-only client the result says the opposite thing, because there the assistant
relaying the diff and handing over the URL is all that can happen.

What a merge does, in this order, because the hub accepts no other:

0. **Re-read the lesson and stop if it moved.** The push below is conditional on the tip
   that was read, which catches anyone who saved the ordinary way — the editor pushes
   history first and the row second. The row itself has no such guard: `PUT /lessons/:id`
   takes the document it is given. So a write that moved the row _without_ moving history
   (an edit whose own history push failed leaves exactly that) would be overwritten by the
   merged document. Re-reading at the last moment doesn't make the write atomic, but it
   means a race ends with nothing done rather than with somebody's save reverted. Giving
   the row a real precondition would change the Worker's contract for every writer.
1. **Push the merged history.** A three-way merge of the lesson's saved document and the
   proposal's, joined by a commit with two parents. If the lesson has moved on underneath,
   the push is refused rather than overwriting it, and the proposal stays open.
2. **Save the merged document** to the lesson.
3. **Record the proposal as merged.** The hub refuses this unless the merge commit is what
   the lesson's stored history already points at — so the first two steps are not
   bookkeeping around the third, they are what makes it true.

The merge commit lands under the reviewer's own name, since they decided it, with a note
saying it was merged from the proposal view rather than in the web app.

**Conflicts are not merged here.** A block both sides have rewritten is a question for a
human with the two versions side by side, and the web app has the dialog for it. Rather
than guess — or build a second conflict UI into an inline card — `merge_proposal` refuses,
names the contested blocks, and gives the proposal's URL. The lesson is untouched when it
does — as it is for each of the three ways a merge declines to happen: a conflict, a
proposal resolved while it was on screen, and a lesson saved under it.

Declining drops the proposal's changes, keeps its row and title so the conversation stays
visible, and notifies its author — exactly as declining in the web app does.

## Editing a lesson: patch vs. replace

For tweaks, prefer **`patch_lesson`** — `get_lesson` to read the current section/block
**ids**, then send a small list of operations that address those ids, e.g.:

```json
{
  "id": "…",
  "operations": [
    { "op": "set_section_name", "sectionId": "…", "name": "Volcano basics" },
    {
      "op": "replace_block",
      "blockId": "…",
      "block": { "type": "text", "text": "Magma RISES." }
    },
    {
      "op": "add_block",
      "sectionId": "…",
      "block": {
        "type": "question",
        "questionType": "single",
        "prompt": "What rises?",
        "answer": "magma"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Ops: `set_title`, `set_section_name`, `add_section`, `remove_section`, `move_section`,
`add_block`, `replace_block` (keeps the block id), `remove_block`, `move_block`. The
server fetches the lesson, applies the ops in order, and saves the result (the hub API
itself only does full replaces, so the diff is applied server-side). Use `update_lesson`
when you're rewriting the whole lesson anyway.

## Building a lesson in passes

`patch_lesson` isn't only for tweaks. A six-section lesson is a lot to get right in one
`create_lesson` call, and that call is all-or-nothing — one grounding failure anywhere and
nothing is saved. The alternative is to create the first section or two and add the rest a
pass at a time:

```text
validate_lesson({ sections: [ … ] })        -> check the section you just wrote
create_lesson({ title, sections: [ … ] })   -> the lesson exists after one section
validate_lesson({ id, operations: [ … ] })  -> check the next pass before sending it
patch_lesson({ id, operations, summary })   -> add it
```

Each pass is checked on its own, reversible on its own, and named on its own. Composing the
whole document locally and writing it in one `create_lesson` is equally fine — the thing to
avoid is writing six sections blind and hoping, which is what the tools used to require.

**Name each pass with `summary`.** `patch_lesson` and `update_lesson` both take one, and it
becomes the version's title in the **History** tab:

```json
{ "id": "…", "operations": [ … ], "summary": "Add section 3: volcanic ash" }
```

Without it the version is named after what mechanically changed ("Add 15 question blocks"),
which is accurate and says nothing about why — fine for a one-off tweak, and poor for six
passes the user has to open one by one to tell apart. The summary replaces the subject line
only: the itemised operations and the "made by an AI assistant" note still follow in the
commit body. It's clamped to 72 characters.

One reason to prefer `patch_lesson` over `update_lesson` for this: `update_lesson` rebuilds
every section and block id, so its diff reads as a wholesale add-and-remove even for a
one-word change. `patch_lesson` addresses blocks by id, so the history records what actually
moved.

There is a second reason to prefer patching. Both tools check the result against the
authoring standard, but `patch_lesson` holds the caller only to the defects its edit
introduced, whereas `update_lesson` replaces the whole document and so owns everything in
it — including problems inherited from the lesson it fetched. See
[Lesson validation](/mcp-server/lesson-validation).

## Lesson shape the assistant fills

By default (unless you ask for something different), the assistant builds **6 sections**, each
one an optional image, 2 text paragraphs, 4 spelling words, and 15 questions in a fixed order —
covering verbatim-in-text, fill-in-the-blank, word-problem, list-retrieval,
background-knowledge, and open-ended question types. This default (and the rest of the authoring conventions — spelling-
word rules, math `steps`, image placement, tone) is sent to the connecting assistant as the
server's MCP `instructions`, so most clients apply it automatically. Not every client surfaces
server `instructions` to the model — notably claude.ai's connector UI doesn't — so the full
standard is also embedded directly in `create_lesson`'s tool description (`create_lesson_file`
just points to it, rather than repeating it) to make sure it reaches the model either way.

The half of the standard a script can decide doesn't rely on the model having read anything:
every tool that writes a lesson validates it first and **rejects** the write on a grounding,
spelling-word or uniqueness failure, with a message naming the section, the value and the fix.
Softer shape problems come back as a `warnings` array on the saved result. `skipValidation: true`
turns the errors off for a user who deliberately wants something the standard forbids. See
[Lesson validation](/mcp-server/lesson-validation) for every code.

Because a rejected write is all-or-nothing, an assistant composing six sections in one call
has to get every one of them right first time. **`validate_lesson`** runs the same checks
without saving, so it can build a section, check it, fix what the messages name, and only
call `create_lesson` once the whole thing comes back clean. See
[Checking before you write](/mcp-server/lesson-validation#checking-before-you-write).

A lesson is **sections** of **blocks**. Block types:

- **`text`** — a paragraph. Put words you're teaching the spelling of in **ALL
  CAPS**; the app highlights them as spelling words.
- **`spelling`** — an explicit word list: `{ "type": "spelling", "words": ["BECAUSE", "FRIEND"] }`.
- **`question`** — a quiz question with a `questionType`:
  - `number` → `answer` (numeric), plus optional `steps` (array of worked-solution steps, in order)
  - `single` → `answer` (one text answer)
  - `multiple` → `answers` (array of accepted answers — the items of a list the passage
    states explicitly, with the prompt quoting that sentence with the list blanked out)
  - `multiple_open` → `answers` (array of **suggested** answers for the looser semi-open
    question — a synonym, a definition, anything bounded by the topic. The key is a guide,
    not a match target: the speller need not produce one of them, and the answers are held
    neither to the passage nor to a list)
  - `paraphrase` → free response restating the passage in the speller's own words
    (no answer field; just the `prompt`)
  - `open` → free response (no answer field; just the `prompt`)
  - `background` → `background` + `answer` (needs prior knowledge)

- **`image`** — a picture. Don't write these by hand; use `search_images` to find a
  freely-licensed Wikimedia Commons image, then `add_image` with its `ref` to download
  the bytes, store them, and insert the block. The licence attribution is set as the
  caption automatically.
- **`vakt`** — a regulation activity: `{ "type": "vakt", "text": "Bob likes to do jumping
jacks. Let's do 3 of those." }`, optionally with `links` (`{ url, label? }` pairs) and an
  `image` from `add_image`. Write the activity **alone** — the `VAKT:` label is added when
  the lesson is rendered. These are **optional and off by default**: only add them when the
  user asks. When they do, a section gets one and it goes **last**, after that section's
  questions. See [VAKT activities](/web-app/vakt-activities).

## Placing an image

`add_image` needs somewhere to put the block. In order of precedence:

1. **`afterBlockId`** — insert directly after a specific block id (from `get_lesson`).
   This is the most reliable way to place an image next to the content it illustrates,
   since it pins both the section and the position without any index arithmetic.
2. **`sectionId`** / **`sectionIndex`** + optional **`index`** — target a section
   explicitly and, optionally, a 0-based position within it.
3. If none of the above are given, the image is inserted at the end of the **last**
   section's prose, just before any trailing question block(s) — never buried after
   the quiz.

The standard puts a section's image **first**, above both paragraphs, so a lesson written
to it passes `sectionId`/`sectionIndex` with `index: 0` rather than relying on the default.

## Letting the user pick the picture

Candidates are photographs, and an assistant can only describe them. On a client that
renders [interactive views](./interactive-views.md), `search_images` shows them instead:
the results come back as a row of cards the user scrolls, and choosing one is a click.

Pass **`lessonId`** (and **`sectionIndex`**, when the picture belongs to a particular
section) whenever the assistant already knows where the image is going. The button on each
card then calls `add_image` itself — over the same authenticated connection, placing the
picture first in that section as the standard asks — so the user's choice becomes an image
in the lesson without another turn. Without a `lessonId` — or on a client that won't carry
a tool call on the view's behalf — the card still works: picking one tells the assistant
which `ref` to use, and it places the image as usual.

**The assistant is told to stop when the picker is showing.** This is the one place the
server says different things to different clients, and it has to: the same result means
"choose one" to a text client and "stand back" to a rendered one. `search_images` checks
whether the connected host negotiated the MCP Apps extension, and when it did, the result
leads with an instruction to end the turn — don't call `add_image`, don't pick from the
descriptions — and the payload follows behind it. Without that, the assistant reads a list
of candidates, does the obvious thing with it, and adds a picture of its own choosing while
the user is still looking at the cards; the choice the picker exists to hand over is taken
back before they can make it.

A client that renders nothing at all gets exactly the text result it always did, list and
"choose the best `ref`" alike; the picker reads the identical payload either way.

`add_image` downloads a **downscaled rendering** (Commons is asked for a thumbnail ~1600px
wide, and again at ~1000px if that one is still heavy) rather than the original file, so
the assistant chooses a candidate on its content and never on its file size. This is not
only bandwidth: the hub re-encodes PNG/JPEG uploads to WEBP inside a Worker, and a
full-size scan used to exhaust that Worker's resources — a failure no retry could fix. A
file that stays over the 8 MB upload limit even at the smallest rendering Commons will
produce is refused with a message saying to pick a different candidate.
