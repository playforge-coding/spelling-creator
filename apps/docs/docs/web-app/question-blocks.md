# Question blocks

Each section can hold **question blocks** alongside text, images, spelling lists
and [VAKT activities](./vakt-activities.md). Pick a type
from the **Add question** menu; every type is colour-coded so it's easy to scan
the lesson at a glance. The types, their shape, and their colours live in one
place, `packages/core/src/questions.js`, so the editor and both exporters stay in sync.

| Type                     | Colour          | What it captures                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Number answer**        | purple          | A single numeric answer, with an optional extendable list of solution steps. |
| **Single answer**        | green           | A list of options with exactly one correct choice.                           |
| **Multiple answers**     | amber           | Several accepted answers; any one of them is right.                          |
| **Suggested answers**    | amber, _italic_ | Several suggested answers. The key is a guide — other answers can be right.  |
| **Paraphrase**           | brown           | Restate the passage in their own words. No stored answer.                    |
| **Open ended**           | pink            | A free written response.                                                     |
| **Background knowledge** | blue            | A prompt plus the prior knowledge a student needs to answer it.              |

**Multiple answers** is amber rather than the burnt orange it used to be: it
would otherwise sit too close to **Paraphrase**'s brown, and in a printed lesson
a question's marking is nearly all it has to go on.

## The two amber types

**Multiple answers** and **Suggested answers** are one family — the _semi-open_
questions — and they share the amber deliberately. What they disagree about is
what the answer list means:

- **Multiple answers** — the list is the **complete accepted set**. In a lesson
  written to the [authoring standard](/mcp-server/tools), it is every item of a
  list the passage states outright, and the prompt quotes that sentence with the
  list blanked out.
- **Suggested answers** — the list is a **suggestion**. The question is bounded
  by the topic ("Give a synonym for GRATITUDE"), and a student who answers
  something else that fits is also right.

Since nothing in a printed lesson names a question's type, two types sharing a
colour would be two types a reader cannot tell apart — so **Suggested answers**
prints in _italic_, in the body and in the footer legend alike. That mark is
load-bearing: it is what tells whoever is marking the lesson that this one
answer key is advisory. It exists because the palette has no seventh colour
left that reads as orange without colliding with **Paraphrase**'s brown.

The editor doesn't need the italic — every question there carries a type badge —
so the two are told apart by the badge and by the help text under the answer
rows.

In the editor each question also shows its position within its section — `Q7`,
next to the type badge. A standard section holds fifteen of them, and the type
badge alone doesn't distinguish one from the next, so the number is what makes a
question findable again after you've scrolled away from it (see
[Navigating large lessons](./navigating-large-lessons.md#question-numbering)).
It's editor-only chrome: nothing is written into the document or the export.

A question prints as its **prompt in the colour of its type, followed by its
answer in black on the same line** — nothing is labelled or bracketed, so the
colour, plus the italic on **Suggested answers**, is what marks the type. The
footer legend on every page names the types the same way (see
[the export pipeline](./export-pipeline.md)). A question with no recorded answer,
and the free-response types (**Paraphrase** and **Open ended**), print as the
prompt alone.

Number-answer questions can also hold a list of **steps** — the worked-out
stages of solving the problem. Use **Add step** in the editor to grow the
list, and remove any row you don't need; the list starts empty since steps
are optional. Steps print as an indented numbered list under the question, and
round-trip through both JSON and DOCX import.
