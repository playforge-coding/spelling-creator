# Spelling Lesson Maker

A web app for building and printing [**Spelling**](https://i-asc.org) (also known as S2C) lessons.
Create a document, add named sections, and fill each section with text and
images. Export the finished lesson as a Word document (`.docx`) or print it to
PDF.

Built with **React + Vite + shadcn/ui + Tailwind**, using [`docx`](https://docx.js.org) for Word
export and [`html2pdf.js`](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js) (via
[`mammoth`](https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js) docx→HTML conversion) for
PDF printing.

## Features

- **Document title** - name the whole lesson.
- **Add sections** with the floating **+** button; each new section is named in a dialog.
- **Text and image blocks** inside any section. Add, caption, reorder, or delete them.
- **Search images** - find free Pixabay images from within a section and insert
  one with a click (see [Search images](./search-images.md)).
- **Question blocks** - add structured questions in seven types (see [Question blocks](./question-blocks.md)).
- **VAKT activities** - drop a regulation break into a section: a red, labelled
  "VAKT: …" activity a speller does rather than answers, optionally with a
  picture and links. It's a content block, not a question — it's never scored and
  never counted by interactive mode (see [VAKT activities](./vakt-activities.md)).
- **AI text suggestions** - generate a block of lesson text from a section's
  title with one click (see [AI text suggestions](./ai-text-suggestions.md)).
- **AI question suggestions** - generate a structured question of any type from
  a section's title and existing text (see [AI question suggestions](./ai-question-suggestions.md)).
- **AI lesson ideas** - get a batch of lesson topic suggestions for an age range
  to start from a blank document (see [AI lesson ideas](./ai-lesson-ideas.md)).
- **Lesson summaries** - summarise a published lesson with the browser's built-in
  AI, running entirely on the reader's own device (no server, no cost). Only
  appears on browsers that can actually run it (see
  [Lesson summaries](./lesson-summaries.md)).
- **Interactive lesson mode** - work through any published lesson instead of
  reading it: each section's material appears full-screen on its own, then its
  questions one at a time with a field to type an answer into. Every lesson ever
  published already works — the walkthrough is derived from the document itself.
  What you type is saved **privately to your account** when you finish, readable
  by you and nobody else (not even the lesson's author), and any step can be read
  aloud by the browser's own speech synthesis. You needn't finish in one sitting:
  an unfinished run-through is kept in the browser and the lesson reopens where
  you left it. Whoever is presenting can toggle the author's answers on screen
  (see [Interactive lesson mode](./interactive-mode.md)).
- **Navigating a long lesson** - a finished lesson runs to ~37 screens on a
  desktop and ~54 on a phone, so each section's header is sticky (pinned below
  the app bar, naming the section you're in for as long as you're in it), every
  question is numbered within its section (`Q7`), a newly added section is
  scrolled to rather than silently appended at the end, reordering a section or
  block keeps it under the pointer instead of flinging the page, and returning
  to the editor puts you back at the block you were last editing (see
  [Navigating large lessons](./navigating-large-lessons.md)).
- **Preview** - a toggle, not a window. Pressing **Preview** replaces the editing
  panes with the lesson exactly as a reader sees it, in the same place and at the
  same width, with the section outline still beside it and still navigating;
  pressing it again returns you to editing. Nothing is built to show it — see
  [How the export pipeline works](./export-pipeline.md).
- **Collapse sections** - fold any section to its header, or the whole lesson at
  once, turning 37 screens into 1.5. A folded section still says what's inside
  it, still reorders, still takes a dragged block (dwell over it and it springs
  open), and is still found by Cmd-F. What you fold is yours — it isn't saved
  into the lesson and collaborators don't see it.
- **Reorder / delete** sections and blocks with inline controls. On a device
  with a mouse or trackpad, blocks can also be dragged by their grab handle,
  both within a section and **from one section into another** (an empty section
  shows a drop zone that takes the block). An insertion line shows where the
  block will land — anywhere in a section, including the gaps between blocks —
  and holding the pointer near the top or bottom of the window scrolls the page
  on its own, so a block can be carried to a section well past the visible part
  of a long lesson. The grab handle is hidden on touch devices, where the
  browser doesn't deliver drag events at all; the move up/down buttons do the
  same job (see [Mobile layout & touch targets](./mobile-layout.md)).
- **Export DOCX** - downloads a formatted `.docx`.
- **Print PDF** - builds the docx, converts it to HTML with mammoth, then renders
  a PDF with html2pdf.js so the printout mirrors the Word document. Along with
  the DOCX export (and the Drive upload, which is that same file), this is the
  only place a Word document is built — **Preview** and the published lesson page
  both render the lesson straight to React, in the app's light/dark theme, so a
  preview opens instantly and shows exactly what a reader sees (see
  [How the export pipeline works](./export-pipeline.md)).
- **Save to Google Docs** - signs in with Google (OAuth2) and uploads the docx to
  the user's Drive, converting it to a native Google Doc (see [Save to Google Docs](./save-to-google-docs.md)).
- **Lesson hub** - browse lessons other users have published, preview any of them,
  and publish your own once signed in (see [Lesson hub & accounts](./lesson-hub-and-accounts.md)).
- **Comments & ratings** - discuss a published lesson in a threaded comment box,
  and leave a 1–5 star rating with your comment; the lesson page shows the average
  (see [Lesson hub & accounts](./lesson-hub-and-accounts.md)). Comments (and bios)
  are **rich text** — formatting and links, but no embedded media — and you can edit
  your own after posting (see [Rich text](./rich-text.md)).
- **Accounts** - passwordless magic-link sign-in (Supabase Auth) on a dedicated
  login page; required only to publish to the hub (see [Lesson hub & accounts](./lesson-hub-and-accounts.md)).
- **Profiles & display names** - every user picks a public display name and an
  optional rich-text bio, with a public profile page listing their lessons. Signed-in users
  can **follow** each other, and a home-page feed shows the activity of people you
  follow (see [Profiles & display names](./profiles-and-display-names.md#following)).
- **Notifications** - an in-app bell for replies, comments on your lessons, new
  followers, and links sent to you (see [Notifications](./notifications.md)).
- **Moderation** - moderator/admin tools for comments, shadowbanning, and bans
  (see [Moderation](./moderation.md)).
- **Live collaboration** - invite others to edit a lesson with you in real time
  over a server-side room (a Cloudflare Durable Object, one WebSocket per
  participant), with live cursors and an in-session chat panel. People you invite
  only start collaborating once you add them to the lesson (see
  [Live collaboration](./live-collaboration.md)).
- **Version history** - every lesson is a real git repository in the browser, one
  file per content block. Edits are committed automatically as you pause, so you
  can browse every version and restore any of them. Forking a lesson **clones**
  its repository, and a fork can later pull the original's changes in — merged
  block by block, with edits to different blocks (or different parts of the same
  block) merging automatically (see
  [Version history](/monorepo/version-history)).
- **Pull requests** - propose your fork's changes back to the lesson it came from.
  Nothing there changes until its author, or someone they trust with it, reviews
  and merges your proposal (see [Pull requests](./pull-requests.md)).
- **Auto-save** - your work is kept in IndexedDB between reloads (images as binary
  blobs, so large drafts aren't capped by `localStorage`'s ~5 MB quota).
- **As many lessons as you make** - the editor holds a whole library of them
  locally, each with its own document and version history, and switches between
  them from the **Lessons** button. Opening a lesson from the hub, forking one or
  importing a document adds to that library rather than replacing what you were
  working on (see [Lessons on this device](./local-lessons.md)).
- **Installable, and works offline** - the app can be installed to a Home Screen
  or dock and opens in its own window; a service worker precaches the shell, so
  the editor, version history and DOCX/PDF export all keep working with no
  network (see [Installable app & offline use](./pwa-and-offline.md)).
- **Internationalization** - every user-facing string is routed through
  react-i18next; only English ships today, but adding a language needs no component
  changes (see [Internationalization](./internationalization.md)).
