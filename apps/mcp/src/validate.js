// Lesson-standard validation — the mechanically checkable half of the authoring
// standard stated in standards.md.
//
// The split between the two files is deliberate. standards.md carries the rules
// that need judgement ("a tight open must be answerable instantly"), and it only
// reaches the model if the client surfaces server instructions or tool
// descriptions. This module decides the rules a script can decide on its own, on
// the way into a write, so they hold even when the model never read a word of the
// standard.
//
// Errors reject the write; warnings ride along with a successful one. The line
// between them is whether a legitimate lesson could ever trip the check: a green
// answer that is not in its own passage is always a defect, whereas a five-section
// lesson is usually a mistake and occasionally exactly what the user asked for.
// `skipValidation: true` on the writing tools turns the errors off for the rare
// case where the user genuinely wants something the standard forbids.
//
// Every message names the section, the offending value, and the fix, because the
// model reads the rejection and resubmits: "validation failed" buys a guess, a
// specific message buys a correction in one round trip.

// The guidebook calls both SEMI-OPEN — questions with several known or

// tight to less tight, all printed orange. They are two types rather than one
// with a flag because `answers` means opposite things at the two ends:
//
//   `multiple`      TIGHT. `answers` is the exhaustive accepted set, and it is
//                   every item of one explicit list the passage states. Held to
//                   that hard, because a speller who names the item the question
//                   left out read the passage exactly as told.
//   `multiple_open` LESS TIGHT. `answers` is a SUGGESTION. The question is
//                   bounded by the topic or theme and leaves room to improvise
//                   ("Give a synonym for gratitude"), so an answer that isn't
//                   in the key — and by its nature isn't in the passage either —
//                   can be perfectly right.
